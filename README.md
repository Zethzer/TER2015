# TER2015

Under the guidance of Mr David Vanderhaeghe from the research group AGGA of the VORTEX team at IRIT, the TER is based on the course "Moving Frostbite to Physically Based Rendering" co-written by SÃ©bastien Lagarde and Charles de Rousiers in 2014, for SIGGRAPH. This is creating a shader-based Cook-Torrance using the "vortexengine" real-time 3D rendering engine of the VORTEX team.

It was during my undergraduate degree (2014-2015). The report is in french.

For questions of law, I can't show source code. The engine runs on C++, using OpenGL and GLSL.
